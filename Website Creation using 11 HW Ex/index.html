            <p>For our final project, we chose to build upon our work in Project 2 which displayed how traffic congestion and road work intersects with traffic incidents and bike versus vehicle accidents.  We took a deeper dive into the factors that we believed may have played a role in causing these incidents.  </p>

<p>In Project 2, we used APIs and gathered data we plotted the multiple elements that allow the user to see how areas with increased congestion and areas around construction zones resulted in higher bike versus vehicle accidents on suburban streets.  Our map uses various elements such as heatmaps, pinned locations, and pinned locations with information to visually represent at a glance the different types of data being presented.  We used a hybrid of Leaflet with multiple overlays including a heat map, api calls, and html/css. Leaflet provided a means to generate a standard area map and grab data using an API call to MapQuest. In return we were able to pull in data from MapQuest that gave us overlays pertaining to traffic congestion, or ‘flow’, as well as road construction projects. We pulled in additional data from virginiaroads.org to acquire bike versus vehicle crashes and vehicle versus vehicle crashes. The data from virginiaroads.org was in csv form which we used geoJson to load the data points. </p>

<p>We used machine learning to investigate if the Richmond area housing market was increasing or decreasing to assess if we expect to see more incidents or not. With more people in the metropolitan area we would likely find that there will be more congestion, more required construction to maintain heavily utilized roads, and more accidents between cars and bicyclists. In reviewing the data we found that there was a high level of seasonality that needed to be accounted for and therefore SARIMA was used to forecast future growth in the housing market.</p>

<p>We also used machine learning to investigate possible causes behind bike crashes.  First we had to do some cleaning of the data and we had to find what values we wanted for machine learning.  Using the KNN test, we defined road conditions and used machine learning to analyze poor road conditions and then used predictive analysis to see if there was a strong correlation between bike accidents and road conditions.  After getting the data, we put it into tableau and you can see a strong correlation between road conditions and bike accidents.  We looked at 100 values for the KNN test, which took quite a long time and in the future we will try and reduce the number of samples in order to be more efficient.</p>

<p> Finally, we used Tableau to build a dashboard and plot a new heatmap to further analyze crash data  by looking at a variety of info including fatalities by year & month, top crash events, weather conditions, if alcohol was a factor, and crash severity and overlaid that with housing data by census tract.  From this data, we hoped to find crash "hot spots" that could be attributed to a combination of these factors.  After analyzing this data, we found that some of the most impactful information was related crash severity, year, and top crash events.  One thing that really stood out to us after plotting this information was that the majority of bicycle crashes were at located at intersections, indicating Richmond should take more strives to make these places safer for both automobiles and bicycles. </p>
